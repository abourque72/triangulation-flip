# triangulation-flip
Perform flips on triangulated polygons!
You will need to install python, pip, and tkinter.
---------------------------------------------------

You can edit the size and number of sides in the python file, under the main function.

In a triangulated polygon, a diagonal is an edge shared by two triangles. These two triangles create a quadrilateral, and quadrilaterals have two diagonals. A flip move replaces one diagonal for the other. Finite sequences of flips produce all possible triangulations.

To flip a diagonal, simply left click on it.
